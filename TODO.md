# Tower Page Button Issue Fix

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add alert messages to handleQuickAction for button clicks and action results
- [x] Modify modal overlay CSS to not block clicks on buttons behind it (pointer-events: none on overlay, auto on content)

## Next Steps
- Test the tower page to verify buttons now show alerts and work without modal interference
- If issues persist, investigate further based on alert feedback
- Remove debug alerts once issue is resolved
